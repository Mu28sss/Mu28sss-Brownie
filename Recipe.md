<font size="20">How to Make Brownies </font><br><br>

<font size="20">1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.</font><br><br>

<font size="20">2. Prepare baking dish: spray and 8 by 8 inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray, set aside.</font><br><br>

<font size="20">3. Melt butter: place butter in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat in microwave until just melted.</font><br><br>

<font size="20">4. Mix in sweetener and salt: Stir in sugar and salt, let cool slightly if warm.</font><br><br>

<font size="20">5. Mix in wet ingredients: add in eggs and vanilla. Break yolks and stir with wooden spoon just until blended. </font><br><br>

<font size="20">6. Mix in dry ingredients: add in flour, cocoa powder and chocolate chips. Fold and stir mixture with wooden spoon just until combined.</font><br><br>

<font size="20">7. Add batter to pan: pour into prepared baking dish. Spread into an even layer. Bake in preheated oven just until barely set, about 40 to 46 minutes (toothpick may have a bit of sticky batter, careful not to over-bake).</font><br><br>

<font size="20">8. Cool before cutting (if you can wait!): let cool completely on a wire rack then cut into individual squares. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.</font><br><br>
