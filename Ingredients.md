<font size="10">1. Unsalted butter, salted butter will work too just reduce salt to 1/8 tsp (and do not forget to cover bowl when melting as salted butter splatters more).</font><br><br>

<font size="10">2. Granulated sugar, for a little extra chewiness you could try it with half brown sugar. </font><br><br>

<font size="10">3. Salt, table salt or sea salt work great. If using sea salt use a heaping 1/2 tsp because crystals are usually a little bigger. </font><br><br>

<font size="10">4. Eggs, 3 is the perfect amount to help bind the brownies together. </font><br><br>

<font size="10">5. Vanilla, I like to use a fair amount here for a boost of complimenting flavor.</font><br><br>

<font size="10">6. Unbleached all purpose flour, if bleached flour is what you have on hand it will work too, I am trying to use unbleached flour more as it is not chemically treated so it seems like a smarter option and it tastes better. </font><br><br>

<font size="10">7. Unsweetened cocoa powder, standard unsweetened cocoa powder or dutch process cocoa both work great for this recipe. </font><br><br>

<font size="10">8. Chocolate chips, you can use any intensity you prefer even bittersweet, my family likes milk chocolate chips and they offer that nice crackly top on the brownies with the extra sugar. </font><br><br>
